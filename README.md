This is a project that I've done during my second semester at the uni

It implements a Task Management Module and a Student module.

# Task Management System

## Overview

The Task Management System is a tool designed to facilitate the creation, editing, and management of tasks, as well as the review and assessment of student solutions. The system is divided into two primary modules: the Task Management Module and the Task Checking Module.

## Features

### Task Management Module
- **Create, Edit, and Overwrite Tasks**: Manage task files (.txt) with ease.
- **Content Detection**: Automatically detect LaTeX formulas, image links, and string text within task files.
- **File Linking**: Link task files to folders containing student solutions for easy access.

### Task Checking Module
- **Preview Tasks**: View and navigate through task files.
- **Solution Management**: Request the number of solutions for each task.
- **Solution Viewing**: Iterate through student solutions and retrieve information about submissions from specific students.
